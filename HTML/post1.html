                <h2>Café Story</h2>
                <p id="post">
                    WIC Coffee’s inception was a childhood outdoor adventure amongst grandma's many fruit trees including the big-leafed and lofty liberica coffee. <br><br>
                    The cherries’ hues of red, the otherworldly complexion of the green beans, and the aroma of the roast are to be recalled much later through an espresso machine, 
                    a grinder, a modified popcorn machine and an insatiable desire to make better coffee. <br><br>
                    A special tamper here, a special temperature probe there, joined the growing collection of equipment dedicated to the pursuit of great coffee. <br>
                    A small commercial roaster followed. Then a tiny café tucked away in a quaint suburb became the next outlet for the obsession. <br>
                    The few handfuls of beans at the beginning have turned into a hill of green. <br><br>
                    But even great coffee can be made better. <br><br>
                    So, the madness grows, along with the roaster, the coffee machine, Coffee Lover in Ultimo, 
                    WIC Cafe by Coffee Lover in World Square Complex, Micro cart Coffee in Crown Casino.  <br><br>
                    While we like to work quietly to the tune of our own roasting drums, we also garnered the Australian Barista 
                    Champion title, Coffee Art Champion title, the NSW Championship titles, the inaugural Asia Pacific Cupping Champion title, 
                    the Coffee Guide Sydney "Haven Shot" plus 5 "coffee beans" Award in 2018 and 2019 and the "Best Coffee" award in the SMH Good Cafe Guide in 2017, 2018 & 2019. <br><br>
